# Sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews
This repository contains the codes and data for the final project of CS410 Text Information Retrieval course at UIUC in Fall 2023. The main goal of this project is to build a tool for sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews and perform sentiment analysis on a large collection of reviews from different categories of products, such as clothes, appliances, software, etc. Other goals are to get insight about various factors that correlate with the sentiment of a review, such as the type of words/phrases used, length of the reviews, etc, and also compare different machine learning classifiers for sentiment analysis on this data.
