I ordered a ladies cigarette case for my wife, and a pack of Marlboro 100's would not fit in the case!!!!  I was ripped off!!!  A cigarette case should be able to hold any cigarette pack!!!!  I will not do business with Silverhooks again!!!!\n\nIt's not even worth the postage to send it back!!!!\n\nDissatisfied big time!!!!
