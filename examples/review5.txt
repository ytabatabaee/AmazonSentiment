Maybe it's just me (I have no marketing background but desperately want to learn for my start-up) but I cannot get hardly anything out of this text. I have tried very hard to tread through the writing and learn something useful but chapter after chapter seems to be the exact same thing... overly wordy, rambling & unnecessarily academic writing with no comprehensible message behind it, no strategies I can apply to my own business and no organization that I can make sense of. Feels almost like I'm reading a paper a college student BSed their way through with a whole bunch of long words and cryptic sentences in order to sound impressive. What a rip-off. I paid $70 for this and it has been the most useless book I've paid for in my research process (and I've read 16 other books thus far to help me with my venture).

The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one star is that out of the first six chapters I've read, two of them actually made sense. One was on International Marketing and did a very good job explaining the technology limitations of other countries and the ways foreign citizens adapt to this and use technology. This is actually very helpful information and I'm going to use it. The second was on the legal and ethical aspects of using the internet. It gave an extremely concise explanation with lots of info and it was easily understandable. Unfortunately, I've read a chapter like this over and over and over again in pretty much every e-business book I've picked up so far so it's getting old.
