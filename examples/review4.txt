I've been working with Dreamweaver for a few years now - learning as I go. When I got a chance to request these videos, I thought I'd get a chance to learn Dreamweaver, finally, to maximize its capabilities. And I was totally blown away.\n\nThe videos are superb. The female voiceover is pleasant and very straightforward; there's no attempt at humor and no attempt to replicate a classroom course. The program uses live action sequences to walk us through specific examples, step by step. I was amazed at how many Dreamweaver features I haven't used, just because I didn't even notice they were there.\n\nI am not a web designer but I do know HTML and some CSS. If you don't, I'm not sure the opening video will be enough. It's not like Wordpress where you just dive in.\n\nThe only negative comment I can offer is that the DVD was really hard to dig out of the box! Grab some scissors before getting started.
